## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 

- [x] Create HTML file (index.html)
- [x] Create stylesheet (style.css)
- [x] Create js file (client.js)
- [x] Create jquery.js 

- [x] Source js, jquery and css
- [x] Test the source with a console.log in client.js



The application should have an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

- [] Add the above elements to the HTML 
- [x] Add a Submit button to the HTML
- [] Create a table to display the above elements

A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.

Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Base mode, it does **not** need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.
